      <h3 class="description">I love avocado toast, and if you add an egg to it you have a full meal. Sometimes I use balsamic vinegar to flavor the avocado instead of the lemon juice. You can make the egg any way you like, but I like it best fried or poached.</h4>
        <p>I’ve been obsessed with avo toast for breakfast, especially when I have avocados in my fridge that need to be used up. It’s a simple, healthy breakfast when you need something delicious and fast. I also got Tommy and Karina on board, we all love avocado toast!!</p>
        <p>Adding egg to avocado toast is an easy way to add protein to breakfast toast. If you want a vegan option, you might also like this avocado toast with lemon and kale.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul class="list">
            <li>1 teaspoon butter</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>2 slices multigrain bread</li>
            <li>1 ripe avocado, pitted, peeled</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon lemon juice, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt butter in a skillet over medium-low heat. Crack eggs into the skillet side by side and cook until eggs are white on the bottom layer and firm enough to flip, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip eggs, trying not to crack the yolk, and cook until egg reaches desired doneness, 2 to 5 minutes more.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, toast bread slices to desired doneness, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Mash avocado in a bowl; stir in lemon juice, cayenne pepper, and sea salt. Spread avocado mixture onto toast. Top with fried egg and season with sea salt and pepper.</li>
        </ol>
